"I am who I am because of who I am"
<!--

Trust -- particularly thrust in our institutions - is a vital social resource; when trust works we take it for granted. When trust is lacking structures breakdown. Blockchain creates a world known as the Internet of Value. IDManagement is the source of individual value. With web2 you get to rent space on the Internet, web3 provides the opportunity to own your data. Own your value. The value is the user. Can the user become the owner? With ML the user can become the developer. Identity managagement, then, is the manager of value. "I am who I am because of who I am". Own it.
