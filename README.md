decenterland is a decentralized storage island of safety deposit boxes

Decentralization offers the promise of returning value to the dapplication user. Value created by the user can be owned and controlled by the user. In a perfect environment the user is the developer and the developer is also using the product. In a similar fashion, self-development is the shortest path to accumulating value. Identity requires the choice for privacy. Privacy as a utility should be taken for granted. Communication needs to be either in house or public. Business requires both privacy and publicity as options. When power demands privacy you have censorship.
